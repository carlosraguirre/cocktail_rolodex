Cocktail Rolodex is designed to be a quality of life improvement for me.
Using Ruby on Rails for the backend and Vue.js for the frontend, I created
my Cocktail Rolodex to save and cocktail recipes I find online, on social media,
in books and anywhere in between. Perhaps the most important feature to me is
searching every saved recipe my name or ingredients.
This is where my website excels beyond bookmarking a recipe page in your web browser.

This project was deployed on Railway and Netlify.
